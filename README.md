# -Admission-Management-System
Admission Management System to streamline student applications and admin workflows. Features include online application submission, email notifications with unique IDs, real-time status tracking, and an admin dashboard for updating, reviewing, and deleting applications.
I built a fully functional Admission Management System (AMS) to streamline the student admission process for educational institutions. The system automates the entire journey — from student application to admin review — ensuring a seamless and efficient experience for both students and administrators.

💡 Key Features:

📝 Student Application Portal: Applicants can easily submit their details and receive a unique Application ID.

📬 Email Notifications: Application ID and details are automatically sent to the student’s registered email.

🔍 Real-Time Status Tracking: Students can check their application status anytime using their Application ID.

🛠️ Admin Dashboard: Admins can view, update, and manage applications, add review notes, and even delete applications directly from the interface.

📊 Responsive UI: Clean and modern interface built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for smooth user experience.

🗄️ Secure Backend: Powered by Flask (Python) and SQLite for reliable data storage and management.

🚀 Tech Stack: Python (Flask) | HTML5 | CSS3 | JavaScript | Bootstrap | SQLite

This project taught me how to design and build a complete end-to-end web application — from front-end UI to backend logic, database handling, and email automation — all aimed at solving real-world problems in educational institutions.
