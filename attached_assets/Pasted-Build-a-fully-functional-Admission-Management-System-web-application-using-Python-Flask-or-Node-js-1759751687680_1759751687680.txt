admins table: id, username, password (hashed)

🎨 Frontend:

Clean, responsive, and user-friendly UI with a navbar and footer.

Use Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for styling.

Use modals or separate pages for form submissions and application details.

🔒 Security & Validation:

After a student submits the admission form, the system must:

Generate a unique Application ID (e.g., ADM20251006001).

Send this Application ID via email to the student’s registered email address with a message like:

“Thank you for applying <name>! Your Application ID is ADM20251006001. Use this ID to check your admission status.”
